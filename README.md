# Multimodal Activity Tracker

## Project Overview
The Multimodal Activity Tracker is a comprehensive software suite designed to monitor and analyze user activity across different modalities, including keyboard, mouse, video feeds, and system metrics. It provides real-time tracking, data synchronization, and analytics to facilitate ergonomic evaluations and stress monitoring for HR analytics.

## Installation
To set up the Multimodal Activity Tracker, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update the relevant configurations in the `.env` file.

5. **Run Database Migrations** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage
To utilize the Multimodal Activity Tracker, you will primarily interact with the included modules for different types of data tracking. Below is a quick example of how to set up and run the activity tracker.

### Example Usage
```python
from main import MultimodalIntegration

# Initialize and start the multimodal integration
integration = MultimodalIntegration()
integration.start()

try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    integration.stop()
```

### Capturing Activity
You can capture keyboard, mouse, webcam data through the respective integrations. For more detailed interactions, refer to the individual modules such as `HIDSystemIntegration` and `WebcamIntegration`.

## Features
- **Keyboard and Mouse Tracking**: Capture events with timestamps for comprehensive analysis.
- **Webcam Integration**: Monitor user posture and face detection.
- **Data Synchronization**: Seamlessly synchronize data from different sources for accurate analytics.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning to analyze ergonomic risks and stress levels.
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on user activity and ergonomic assessments.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up alerts for high-stress conditions or poor posture for proactive interventions.
- **Multi-platform Support**: Deployable on cloud platforms with Docker support.

## Dependencies
This project requires several dependencies, which are specified in the `requirements.txt`:
- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn`
- `opencv-python`
- `pymediapipe`
- `pynput`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`, and others as listed.
